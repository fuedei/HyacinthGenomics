# Participation and Data Contribution

To achieve broad geographic and ecological coverage, this project invites researchers to contribute plant tissue samples, extracted DNA, and/or whole-genome sequencing data. The project is designed to be flexible, allowing contributors to participate according to their available resources while adhering to shared standards that ensure data comparability and reproducibility.

Contributors may participate by:

- sending plant tissues preserved in silica gel,
- sending extracted genomic DNA, and/or
- sharing whole-genome sequencing data generated independently.

# How to Participate: Step-by-Step Guide

## Initial contact
Contact the coordinating team to express interest and indicate the type of contribution (plant tissue, DNA, and/or genomic data).

## Sampling and preservation
- Collect young, healthy leaf tissue when possible.
- Preserve tissue immediately in silica gel until fully desiccated.
- Clearly label each sample with a unique identifier.

## Metadata recording
Record standardized metadata for each sample, including (at minimum):
- Geographic coordinates and locality description
- Habitat and environmental context
- Sampling date and collector
- Preservation method

## DNA extraction or sequencing
Contributors may extract genomic DNA the provided guidelines, orPerform whole-genome sequencing locally using short- or long-read technologies.

## Sample or data submission
Ship silica-dried tissues or extracted DNA provided instructions, or share raw sequencing reads and associated metadata through the designated data-transfer platform.

## Data integration and acknowledgment
All contributions will be curated centrally, integrated into downstream analyses, and appropriately acknowledged through co-authorship or formal data citation, depending on the level of contribution.
