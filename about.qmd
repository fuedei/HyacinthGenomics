International Water Hyacinth Genomics Initiative ...

## Collaboration Model

This initiative is designed to be a distributed and inclusive consortium.

-   An open call for participation to research groups worldwide.
-   Clear guidelines on data ownership, authorship, and acknowledgment.
-   Opportunities for co-authored publications and thematic working groups.
-   Regular communication through virtual meetings, workshops, and shared online platforms.

Participation levels are flexible, enabling contributors to engage based on their resources and interests.

Beyond initial data generation, the initiative aims to:

-   Serve as a “living genomic resource”, continuously expanded with new samples and data.
-   Integrate genomic information with ecological, climatic, and distributional data.
-   Support training and capacity building, particularly in regions heavily affected by the invasion.
-   Provide a model framework applicable to other invasive species.
